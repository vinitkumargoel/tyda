Get detailed information for a specific Swiggy Instamart order by order ID. Use this when the user wants to see complete details about a specific order including: full list of items with quantities and prices, itemized bill breakdown (item total, delivery fee, handling fee, grand total), order status, and whether there are any refunds. This tool provides more detailed information than get_orders. Note: For store information, delivery address, or real-time tracking, use get_orders or track_order instead. To use this tool, you need an orderId which can be obtained from the get_orders tool first. Example use cases: "show me details of order 123456", "what items were in my last order", "show me the bill for order 123456", "what was the total for my recent order".

## Example

**TypeScript**
```ts
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "get_order_details",
  arguments: {
    orderId: "ord_42",
  },
});
```

**Python**
```py
result = await session.call_tool(
  "get_order_details",
  arguments={
    "orderId": "ord_42",
  },
)
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://mcp.swiggy.com/im \
