Swiggy Instamart order history - Use this to fetch ORDER HISTORY, past orders, or order preferences. Use this FIRST when user asks: "show my orders", "get my orders", "my last order", "order history", "past orders", "recent orders", "list my orders", "what did I order before", "my previous orders", "check my past orders", "my order preferences", "get preferences from past orders", "what do I usually order", "my frequent items", "reorder", "order again", "buy the same thing", "what groceries did I buy", "my purchase history", "items I bought before". Returns a list of orders from the last 15 days with basic details including items, status, and delivery address coordinates. Set activeOnly=true when user asks for active/current/ongoing orders: "active orders", "current orders", "ongoing orders", "pending orders", "in-progress orders", "orders on the way", "orders being delivered", "my current deliveries". For REAL-TIME TRACKING of a specific order (where is my order, track my order, ETA, delivery partner location), use the track_order tool instead - it requires orderId and coordinates which can be obtained from this tool. Authentication is handled automatically. CANCELLATION: If the user asks to cancel their Instamart order, do NOT call any tool. Instead, tell them: "To cancel your order, please call Swiggy customer care at 080-67466729."

## Example

const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "get_orders",
  arguments: {
    count: 0,
    orderType: "...",
  },
});
```

**Python**
```py
result = await session.call_tool(
  "get_orders",
  arguments={
    "count": 0,
    "orderType": "...",
  },
)
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://mcp.swiggy.com/im \

```json
{
  "success": true,
