Track Swiggy Instamart order status in real-time. PRIMARY TOOL for order tracking - Use this FIRST when user asks: "where is my order", "track my order", "order status", "what's the status of my order", "when will my order arrive", "ETA for my order", "is my order on the way", "has my order been delivered", "track order", "check order status", or any query about a specific order's current status. Returns real-time tracking info including: current status, ETA, delivery partner location, store info, delivery address, items ordered, and payment details. Requires orderId and delivery address coordinates. If user doesn't provide orderId, first use get_orders to find the order, then use this tool to track it.

## Example

**TypeScript**
```ts
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "track_order",
  arguments: {
    orderId: "ord_42",
    lat: 12.9716,
    lng: 77.5946,
  },
});
```

**Python**
```py
result = await session.call_tool(
  "track_order",
  arguments={
    "orderId": "ord_42",
    "lat": 12.9716,
    "lng": 77.5946,
  },
)
```
