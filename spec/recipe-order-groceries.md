# Order groceries end-to-end

> Full Instamart journey - find products, build a cart, checkout, track delivery.

Instamart is Swiggy's quick-commerce grocery service across 1000+ Indian cities. Same shape as Food (discover → cart → order → track), different catalogue.

## The flow

```
get_addresses
     │
     ▼
search_products ──► update_cart ──► get_cart ──► checkout ──► track_order
     ▲                  │
     └──────────────────┘
     your_go_to_items (bypass search)
```

## Step 1 - Resolve the delivery address

```ts
const addresses = await client.callTool({ name: "get_addresses" });
const home = addresses.data.find((a) => a.label === "Home") ?? addresses.data[0];
```

If the user has no addresses, walk them through [`create_address`](/docs/reference/instamart/create_address.md).

## Step 2 - Find products (or reorder)

Two paths. For quick reorders:

```ts
const goTo = await client.callTool({
  name: "your_go_to_items",
  arguments: { addressId: home.id },
});
// goTo.data has frequently-ordered SKUs - present as one-tap add
```

For search:

```ts
const results = await client.callTool({
  name: "search_products",
  arguments: { addressId: home.id, query: "bananas" },
});
```

Each product returns one or more `variants` with their own `spinId` (the SKU-level identifier). You add variants to the cart, not the parent product.

## Step 3 - Build the cart

```ts
await client.callTool({
  name: "update_cart",
  arguments: {
    items: [
      { spinId: results.data.products[0].variants[0].spinId, quantity: 2 },
    ],
  },
});
```

Swapping address mid-cart? Don't. Run [`clear_cart`](/docs/reference/instamart/clear_cart.md) first to avoid cross-address SKU mismatches.

## Step 4 - Review the cart

```ts
const cart = await client.callTool({ name: "get_cart" });
// cart.data has items[], bill breakdown, payment methods available
```

Check `ADDRESS_NOT_SERVICEABLE` or `MIN_ORDER_NOT_MET` errors; Instamart has a ₹99 minimum and service-area restrictions.

## Step 5 - Checkout

```ts
const order = await client.callTool({
  name: "checkout",
  arguments: { paymentMethod: "COD" },
});
```

Same non-idempotency rule as Food: if `checkout` 5xxs, check [`get_orders`](/docs/reference/instamart/get_orders.md) before retrying.

## Step 6 - Track

```ts
const status = await client.callTool({
  name: "track_order",
  arguments: { orderId: order.data.orderId },
});
// ETA typically 10-20 min post-checkout
```

Poll no faster than every 10s.

## Agent prompt

> **Note**
>
> You help users shop on Swiggy Instamart. Start by resolving the user's saved address. Offer `your_go_to_items` for quick reorders; use `search_products` for new queries. Always confirm the cart and total before `checkout`. COD-only in v1.

## Common errors

Until the symbolic `error.code` registry ships (see [errors](/docs/reference/errors.md)), classify by `error.message` text. Expect:

- **Item out of stock** at this address → suggest alternatives from `search_products`.
- **Address not serviceable** → Instamart doesn't deliver here; ask for another address or offer Food.
- **Minimum order not met** (cart under ₹99) → prompt user to add items.
- **Cart expired / abandoned** → rebuild the cart.
