# Plan my evening (combined)

> One user ask, two MCP servers - Food delivery and Dineout reservations composed in a single agent turn.

A fun showcase of MCP's tool-composition strength: the user says "plan my evening for 4 - dinner out, dessert delivered later", and your agent fans out across two Swiggy servers.

## The ask

> **Note**
>
> "Plan my evening for Friday. I want dinner out with 3 friends around 8pm, something Italian in Indiranagar. Then order dessert to my place for 10pm."

This requires both [Dineout](/docs/reference/dineout.md) (for the reservation) and [Food](/docs/reference/food.md) (for the delivery). Both servers share the underlying Swiggy session - one OAuth, two MCP URLs.

## Connect both servers

Most frameworks allow multiple MCP servers side-by-side. Example with OpenAI Agents SDK:

```ts
const dineout = new MCPServerStreamableHttp({
  url: "https://mcp.swiggy.com/dineout",
  requestInit: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } },
});
const food = new MCPServerStreamableHttp({
  url: "https://mcp.swiggy.com/food",
  requestInit: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } },
});

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "EveningPlanner",
  instructions: "Plan the user's evening using both servers.",
  mcpServers: [dineout, food],
});
```

Tool names don't collide - `search_restaurants` (Food) and `search_restaurants_dineout` are distinct.

## What the agent does

Internally, the model orchestrates the two flows in parallel:

```
                  ┌──────────────────────────┐
                  │  User: Plan my evening    │

                                                  ▼
                                        search_restaurants
                                           (query="gelato",
                                            addressId=home)
                                                  │
                                                  ▼

                                                  ▼

                                                  ▼
                                        place_food_order (scheduled 10pm)
```

## Agent prompt for this pattern

> **Note**
>
> You compose Swiggy Dineout and Swiggy Food tools to plan user evenings. When the user asks for a restaurant reservation AND food delivery in one request, handle them sequentially: reservation first (so they see slot options early), then dessert/delivery second. Always confirm reservation details and food cart separately before calling `book_table` and `place_food_order`.

## Handle auth expiry across both servers

If one server returns 401, your session is gone for both. Re-run the OAuth flow once, update the bearer for both clients, retry.

## Gotchas

- **Scheduling**: `place_food_order` places orders for immediate delivery. Swiggy Food doesn't support future-scheduled delivery in v1 - if the user wants dessert at 10pm exactly, your agent needs to remind them / place the order at the right time.
- **Address vs location**: Dineout uses lat/lng for "near me"; Food uses `addressId`. They're different scopes. Don't try to pass an addressId to Dineout search.
- **Cart conflicts**: Food cart is per-restaurant. If your agent adds to cart, then searches a different restaurant, the cart will be flushed. Surface that explicitly.
