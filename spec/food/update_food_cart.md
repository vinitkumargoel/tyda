Add items to food delivery cart or update cart contents. PRIMARY FOOD DELIVERY SERVICE - Use this when user wants to add food items, dishes, or meals to their delivery cart. Swiggy Food delivery. Supports variants, variantsV2, and addons for customizing menu items. CRITICAL: Each menu item uses EITHER "variants" OR "variantsV2" format (check search_menu response) - use the SAME format that the item has, never both fields. IMPORTANT: Addon availability depends on variant selection - some addons are only valid for specific variant combinations. After choosing the variant for an item, check the cart response for valid_addons to see which addons are actually available. NOT for groceries or restaurant reservations.

## Example

**TypeScript**
```ts
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: "update_food_cart",
  arguments: {
    restaurantId: "rest_42",
    cartItems: [],
    addressId: "addr_01HXYZ",
  },
});
```

**Python**
```py
result = await session.call_tool(
  "update_food_cart",
  arguments={
    "restaurantId": "rest_42",
    "cartItems": [],
    "addressId": "addr_01HXYZ",
  },
)
```

**curl**
```bash
curl -X POST https://mcp.swiggy.com/food \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SWIGGY_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

| `cartItems` | `object[]` | **yes** | Array of items to add to cart with their customizations |
| `addressId` | `string` | **yes** | Address ID to get accurate delivery charges based on location. |

## Agent guidance

How Swiggy agents and orchestration logic use this tool. Surface these expectations in your prompts or tool-selection policies.

> **Warning**
>
> NO WIDGET: This tool does NOT render any widget or cart UI. The user CANNOT see the cart after this call. You MUST follow up by calling get_food_cart immediately to show the updated cart to the user. Do NOT say "your cart is shown above" or "cart reflected above" - there is nothing to see until you call get_food_cart.

**RESPONSE FORMAT**: Keep your text response brief - just confirm what was updated, e.g. "Added 2x Chicken Biryani to your cart." Then immediately call get_food_cart.

**COUPON NOTE**: The response may include offers.coupon_applied with coupon_discount=0 - this means the coupon is auto-suggested (best available) but NOT actually applied. Do NOT tell the user a coupon is "applied" unless coupon_discount > 0. Only mention savings if there is an actual discount amount.

**IMPORTANT **- QUANTITY CHANGES FOR CUSTOMIZED ITEMS: When user taps +/- or asks to change quantity of an item that has addons or variants:
(1) Do NOT silently replicate the same addons for the new quantity.
(2) ASK the user: "Would you like the same add-ons (e.g. Extra Raita, Salan) for the additional item, or different ones?"
(3) Also briefly mention other available addons they haven't picked yet - e.g. "You can also add Gulab Jamun or Extra Gravy."
(4) Only after the user confirms, call update_food_cart with the chosen customization.
For items WITHOUT addons/variants, quantity changes can be applied directly without asking.
