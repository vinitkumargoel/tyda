## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `addressId` | `string` | **yes** | Address ID to get accurate delivery charges based on location. |
| `restaurantName` | `string` | no | Restaurant name from search_restaurants or search_menu results. Pass this so the cart widget can display the restaurant name (the cart API does not always return it). |

## Agent guidance

How Swiggy agents and orchestration logic use this tool. Surface these expectations in your prompts or tool-selection policies.

PAYMENT METHODS: The response includes an "availablePaymentMethods" array in data. Display whatever payment method(s) are returned to the user before placing the order. Do not mention or assume any payment option that is not in the response.

COUPON NOTE: The response may include offers.coupon_applied with coupon_discount=0 - this means the coupon is auto-suggested (best available) but NOT actually applied. Do NOT tell the user a coupon is "applied" or show savings unless coupon_discount > 0.
