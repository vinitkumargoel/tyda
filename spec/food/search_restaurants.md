## Agent guidance

How Swiggy agents and orchestration logic use this tool. Surface these expectations in your prompts or tool-selection policies.

IMPORTANT: Each restaurant in the response includes an "availabilityStatus" field with values "OPEN", "CLOSED", or "UNAVAILABLE". Always check this status before proceeding: only recommend or add items from restaurants with availabilityStatus "OPEN". If a restaurant is "CLOSED" or "UNAVAILABLE", inform the user and suggest open alternatives from the results.

After showing results, let the user pick a restaurant before searching the menu. Do NOT automatically call search_menu - wait for the user to choose.

IMPORTANT: When user asks for more options or different dishes after seeing search_menu results, first call get_restaurant_menu to discover available menu categories at the restaurant. Then call search_menu with a different category/dish name to show fresh results. Do NOT re-run search_menu with the exact same query - it will return identical results.

DISTANCE & RELEVANCE: Results are sorted by a mix of distance, rating, and relevance. Each restaurant has a "distanceKm" field. When presenting results in text: (1) Prioritize nearby restaurants with good ratings first, (2) Always mention distance for far restaurants so the user can decide - e.g. "Biryani House (8.2 km away, ~40 min delivery)", (3) Never silently recommend a far restaurant without mentioning distance and expected delivery time.

GENERIC QUERIES: When user asks generic things like "popular restaurants", "best food", "what should I eat", "suggest something" - the search API handles natural language queries with query understanding. Search with broad cuisine terms like "biryani", "pizza", "chinese", "thali" based on meal time (lunch → thali/biryani/rice, dinner → similar, snack → rolls/momos/sandwich, late night → pizza/burger). Present a curated mix of top-rated nearby options across cuisines rather than dumping raw results.
